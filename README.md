# Dunk-a-Duck

Dunk-a-Duck is a simple duck shooting game I wrote in C# with the Unity Engine to improve my programming abilities.

You can find the C#-scripts under /Assets/Scripts and the playable html-file under /Dunk-a-Duck/index.html, which was auto-generated by Unity for WebGL.

You can also play the game on my itch.io-page.
